# TODO

## Methodology
- [X] Implement the model like the paper
- [X] Implement the "fake image generation"
  - [X] Implement threshoding to segment
  - [X] Implement Cannny edge detection to simulate the free-form sketch
- [X] Select images from LUNA16 dataset

## Productionalize

- [X] Create Cropping Pipeline
  - [X] Try to save with black and white (double check the paper)
- [ ] Create Input Image Generation Pipeline
  - [ ] Should be easy to relate the input image to the real image
- [ ] Create the model - Productionalized
  - [ ] Should be easy to train the model
  - [ ] Should be easy to test the model
  - [ ] Should be easy to generate metrics

## Test
- [ ] Test the model
- [ ] Select metrics
- [ ] Generate the metrics
